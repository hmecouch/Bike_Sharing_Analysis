# Citi Bike Analysis


## Overview


Citi Bike is a bike share program with bikes locked into a network of docking stations all over the NYC area. It's now the largest bike sharing program in the nation, boasting a fleet of 27,000 bikes and 1,700 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Jersey City, and Hoboken. This system provides New Yorkers and visitors with an additional transportation option that is fun, efficient, environmentally friendly and convenient. 

Citi Bike data can provide valuable insights for entrepreneurs considering starting a bike sharing program in their city. The analysis should include factors such as usage patterns, peak times, revenue, and customer demographics. This information can be used to determine the feasibility and potential profitability of a bike sharing program in a specific location. The data should be analyzed carefully and thoroughly to draw accurate conclusions and make informed decisions for potential investors.
